        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>In the rapidly evolving digital era, organizations have complex, high-volume, and diverse data sources. The data growth in almost all domains advanced data engineering solutions to enable seamless ingestion, integration, and transformation of information into actionable insights. Traditional data engineering methodologies often fall short in addressing these challenges, particularly in the face of dynamic business needs, real-time decision-making demands, and heightened expectations for scalability, accuracy, and efficiency.</p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in data engineering, fundamentally reshaping the design, implementation, and optimization of data pipelines and architectures. By leveraging machine learning models, generative AI, and intelligent automation, organizations can address critical challenges such as data quality assurance, anomaly detection, and metadata management at an unprecedented scale. AI not only accelerates traditional processes but also introduces new paradigms in data profiling, stream analytics, and knowledge discovery, making it a cornerstone of modern enterprise systems.</p>
        <p>This workshop aims to explore the intersection of innovative solutions for data engineering, focusing on their synergistic application in enterprise information systems and business intelligence. It will highlight innovative models, techniques, and tools to enhance data engineering workflows, streamline information system integration, and enable advanced analytics. Particular emphasis will be given to AI-enhanced data pipelines, real-time data processing, and adaptive architectures designed to meet the evolving demands of enterprise environments. By fostering a dialogue among researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders, the workshop seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical advances data engineering and practical implementations, with the ultimate goal of driving innovation in enterprise-scale decision-making systems.</p>

        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Submission:</strong> It is recommended that papers are submitted for review with around 10 pages, with the recommended font size and page format, including references, tables, graphs, images, and appendices, as indicated in the main conference author’s kit. Submissions with less than 4 pages or more than 13 pages will be automatically rejected.</p>
            <p><strong>Acceptance:</strong> After a double-blind peer review, qualifying papers may be accepted as either Full Papers or Short Papers. The acceptance of papers must be supervised by the Conference and Program Chairs, because the papers will be published in the conference proceedings.</p>
            <p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Papers classified as Full Papers are awarded a 25-minute slot (including the time for questions and discussion) for oral presentation. Papers classified as Short Papers are given either a 20-minute slot (including the time for questions and discussion) for an oral presentation or assigned to a Poster Session, as decided by the Workshop chairs.</p>
            <p><strong>Publication:</strong> Papers accepted for the Workshop are published in the Conference Proceedings. Papers accepted as Full Papers have a 12-page limit in the Proceedings, while Papers accepted as Short Papers have an 8-page limit. The total number of pages to consider is counted after the paper has been correctly formatted according to the appropriate template. The Conference Proceedings will be published under an ISBN and/or ISSN number by SCITEPRESS and include the final versions of all accepted papers, adjusted to satisfy reviewers’ recommendations. Proceedings will be available on paper as well as on digital support at the SCITEPRESS Digital Library. However, online publication is exclusive to papers which have been both published and presented at the event.</p>
            <p><strong>Indexation:</strong> The proceedings will be submitted to various international indexers, such as: Google Scholar, Scopus, EI (Elsevier Index), Semantic Scholar, DBLP, and others.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-Publication and Best Paper Awards:</strong> Regarding post-publications and best paper awards, only the papers that had additional reviews performed by independent members of the Conference program committee are candidates either to post-publications or to best paper awards.</p>
        </div>
        bers of the Program Committee. Based on the Program Committee evaluation, the Conference Chairs can reject or accept a paper. In the latter case, it can be accepted as the type originally submitted or as another type. Thus, full papers can be accepted as short papers.</p>
